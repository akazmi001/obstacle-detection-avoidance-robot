# Components List for Obstacle Detection and Avoidance Robot

This document outlines all the necessary components and hardware used in the **Obstacle Detection and Avoidance Robot** project. These components were carefully selected to ensure the functionality and performance of the robot.

## 1. **Arduino Uno**
   - **Description**: The Arduino Uno is the brain of the robot, providing control over the motors, ultrasonic sensor, and other components.
   - **Quantity**: 1
   - **Purpose**: To process the sensor data and control the movement of the robot.

## 2. **Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)**
   - **Description**: The ultrasonic sensor is used to detect obstacles by measuring the distance between the robot and an object using sound waves.
   - **Quantity**: 1
   - **Purpose**: To detect obstacles in front of the robot and help decide when to turn or move back.

## 3. **Motor Driver (L298N)**
   - **Description**: The motor driver is used to control the direction and speed of the DC motors.
   - **Quantity**: 1
   - **Purpose**: To drive the DC motors by controlling the direction and speed based on the signals from the Arduino.

## 4. **DC Motors**
   - **Description**: DC motors are used to move the robot forward, backward, and rotate.
   - **Quantity**: 2
   - **Purpose**: To move the robot in different directions based on commands from the Arduino.

## 5. **Servo Motor**
   - **Description**: The servo motor is used to control any steering or rotating mechanisms on the robot (if applicable).
   - **Quantity**: 1 (Optional)
   - **Purpose**: To adjust any moving parts or mechanisms, such as steering or rotating the robot's sensors.

## 6. **Jumper Wires**
   - **Description**: Jumper wires are used to make the necessary electrical connections between the Arduino, motor driver, motors, and ultrasonic sensor.
   - **Quantity**: A pack (varies based on connections)
   - **Purpose**: To provide flexible, reusable connections between components.


## 7. **Power Supply (Battery Pack or Power Adapter)**
   - **Description**: A power supply is required to provide power to the Arduino, motors, and sensors.
   - **Quantity**: 1
   - **Purpose**: To power the robot's electronics and motors during operation.
   - **Specification**: Typically, a 7.4V-12V battery pack is used.

## 8. **Chassis (Robot Body)**
   - **Description**: The chassis is the physical structure of the robot, which holds all the components together.
   - **Quantity**: 1
   - **Purpose**: To house all components and ensure the robot's stability during movement.

## 9. **Wheels**
   - **Description**: Wheels are used for the movement of the robot.
   - **Quantity**: 2 (for movement)
   - **Purpose**: To facilitate the robot’s movement based on the commands from the motor driver.

## 10. **Optional Components:**
   - **LED Indicators**: For visual feedback on the robot’s status (e.g., obstacle detection, movement).
   - **Micro-switches**: For adding more sensors or triggering certain actions.
